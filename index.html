                Welcome to the City of Puyallup’s online engagement site for the
                Knutson Farms Environmental Impact Statement project. The City
                is leading the development of an Environmental Impact Statement
                (EIS) for a proposed warehousing development on the approximate
                188-acre Knutson Farm property located within unincorporated
                Pierce County. The EIS is an objective analysis of the likely
                environmental impacts of the proposal and measures to mitigate
                harmful impacts. We are committed to listening to our
                stakeholders and working with you to gather input to help inform
                the EIS. We’re glad you’re part of the conversation!

                      of seven warehouse buildings. Site work activities would
                      include grading, paving parking and truck maneuvering

                      Under Alternative 1, the facility constructed would be the
                      same as described for the Proposed Action; however, rail

                      materials into and out of the proposed facility. The

                The State Environmental Policy Act (SEPA) is a state law that
                requires agencies to evaluate the likely environmental
                consequences of proposed development actions. SEPA provides
                direction for the environmental review process, including
                preparation of an environmental impact statement (EIS) for
                certain projects.

                The City of Puyallup, as lead agency, acknowledges that there is
                public interest and concern about the environmental impacts of
                implementing the proposed development plan (Proposed Action).
                Based on the level of concern and the potential for impacts that
                may occur with the implementation of the Proposed Action, the
                City has determined that a SEPA EIS will be prepared to study
                impacts regardless of whether such impacts may be significant.
                The project’s Determination of Significance can be found in the

                      EIS describes impacts and may identify ways to mitigate

                    Scoping is the first step in the EIS process. During
                    scoping, we invited agencies, tribes, and the general public

                    areas of impact that should be evaluated. These comments

                    impacts from study, and identify alternatives for analysis

                    Construction impacts would occur during the ongoing
                    construction of the project, while operations impacts would
                    continue throughout the lifespan and active use of the

                    DEIS definition of impact significance: SEPA requires that
                    an EIS analyze the adverse environmental impacts of a
                    proposal and identify possible mitigation measures that will
                    reduce or eliminate those impacts. For each environmental
                    resource area, the following thresholds were considered for

                        Analysis in the DEIS includes consideration of future
                        land use designations identified in both the Pierce
                        County Comprehensive Plan and City of Puyallup
                        Comprehensive Plan, as shown in Figures 1-41 and 1-42,
                        below. The land use analysis evaluates the Project’s
                        potential to result in land use conflicts and/or plan
                        and policy inconsistencies that would consequently be
                        considered land use impacts.

                          Auto-Oriented Commercial, B/IP, and LM/W as shown on
                          the City’s Comprehensive Plan future land use map

                          the city Comprehensive Plan. This could result in
                          Building C being removed and Buildings A and E being

                      <p>
                        This section describes the potential for environmental
                        impacts related to aesthetics as a result of Project
                        implementation. Aesthetic experiences can be highly
                        subjective; therefore, Project-related impacts are
                        evaluated based on the extent of the modifications to
                        existing physical conditions on the Project site as a
                        result of the Project. Given the Project’s context and
                        placement within an existing rural developed setting,
                        this analysis follows a qualitative approach to assess
                        the potential visual impacts related to the Project.
                        This analysis was performed by defining the Project
                        location and setting; identifying and characterizing the
                        existing visual resources and key viewers; and assessing
                        resource change and viewer response.
                      </p>

                      <strong>Key mitigation measures:</strong>

                          >
                          The Applicant should use landscaping buffering to
                          promote compatibility between land uses and to reduce
                          the visual impacts of development on users of the site
                          and abutting uses, including the proposed trail. The
                          Project should comply with local building code
                          regulations, including Title 18J.10.055(6) PCC, which
                          requires landscape plans that include the locations
                          and types of landscape buffers and maintenance
                          measures. The landscape buffering should also comply
                          with Title 18J.15.040 PCC, a Level 3 Landscape Buffers
                          requirement, and provide a substantial mix of
                          evergreen and other landscaping elements, including
                          berms and sound walls that buffer the visual and
                          auditory impacts.

                          of Building G (pending final visual analysis), would
                          need to be eliminated, shifted, relocated, redesigned,
                          and/or reduced in size to not create impacts.
                          Additionally, no parking lot(s) or landscaping of
                          trees should occur in the view corridor as those
                          improvements would also create visual interference,
                          glare, screening, and other visual blockage of the
                          public view corridor of Mount Rainier from Van Lierop
                          Park. The park view corridor area should remain as
                          open space to prevent visual obstruction from a major
                          community park. The Applicant and permitting agency
                          (Pierce County) should consult with and receive
                          concurrence from the city of Puyallup Development and
                          Permitting Services and Parks Departments on the
                          visual assessment during permit review by Pierce
                          County. This mitigation measure is consistent with
                          Pierce County Comprehensive Plan Policy LU-47.8 and
                          Pierce County Comprehensive Plan and PROS Plan

                          The Applicant should modify the site plan to provide a
                          new multipurpose trail location, one that runs along
                          the southern bank of the Puyallup River consistent
                          with the location identified in the 2020 Puyallup PROS
                          Plan, as an extension of the existing
                          Foothills/Riverwalk Trail, in keeping with the
                          intended user experience of the Riverwalk Trail to
                          provide the public with a visual connection and/or
                          shoreline access to the Puyallup River. This should
                          include conducting a Trail Routing Feasibility
                          Analysis. The Trail Routing Feasibility Analysis
                          should determine where the least impactful location
                          would be to relocate the proposed trail along the
                          shoreline of the Puyallup River; the Applicant should
                          identify a trail route that will be in conformance
                          with the County and City SMPs and PROS Plans, as well
                          as minimize impacts on floodplain, CMZ(s) and critical
                          areas, and mitigate for any impacts. Special
                          designs—such as elevated boardwalks—should be
                          considered to bridge wetlands, and maintain flood
                          storage capacity and sensitive areas and buffers.
                          Pierce County Parks, City of Puyallup Parks, and user
                          advocate groups (Foothills Trail coalition, Friends of
                          the Riverwalk Trail) should review the overall
                          dimensions and cross section of the trail corridor.
                          The trail design throughout the site planning should
                          utilize significant landscape buffering to separate
                          physically and visually the trail from the industrial
                          park to protect the trail user experience from impacts
                          from the Project operations while implementing Crime
                          Prevention Through Environmental Design (CPTED)

                          the shoreline environment.

                          Consistent with County and City policies calling for
                          trail connectivity with other recreation facilities
                          and community activity centers, the Applicant should
                          provide a trail connection to Van Lierop Park (Pierce
                          County Comprehensive Plan Policies PR-10 and PR-17.1,
                          City PROS Plan Policy 2.3). This could be an east/west
                          trail connection through the site plan to allow trail
                          connectivity from the northwest corner of the park to
                          the trail corridor as shown on the proposed site plan,
                          though it is possible a different alignment may be
                          preferred, for instance, if the site plan changes as
                          called for in other mitigation measures in this EIS.
                          One concept could be to modify the portion of the site
                          containing Buildings F and G by creating a trail
                          corridor break in the site plan to separate the
                          complex into two separate sites with no vehicular
                          access between them. This would create a protected
                          corridor to allow for an east-west connection from Van
                          Lierop Park to the proposed trail on the Project site.
                          The trail corridor could also potentially be placed in
                          the Williams Pipeline corridor, pending approval from
                          Williams through an encroachment agreement. Any
                          connection through the site should contain appropriate
                          landscape buffering, raised crossings,
                          limited/consolidated driveway/parking lot crossings of
                          the trail, and other features to protect trail users,
                          such as way-finding signage indicating “public trail
                          connection” that allow for safe access to the trail.
                          The Project Applicant and Pierce County should seek
                          input from the City of Puyallup Parks Department and
                          Development and Permitting Services Department as the
                          site plan is revised to meet this mitigation measure.

                    The City of Puyallup (City) hired a team of environmental
                    consultants to conduct a rigorous and independent review of

                    prepared pursuant to the State Environmental Policy Act
                    (SEPA). The Draft EIS is now ready for review, and the
                    public has the opportunity to provide comments on the
                    findings from December 14, 2023 to March 15, 2023. The City
                    will review all comments received and prepare a Final EIS,

                    The original development proposal was submitted to Pierce
                    County by the landowner in 2014. The seven-building
                    warehouse project raised several questions and concerns for
                    the City of Puyallup about traffic impacts, utility needs,
                    floodplain and wetlands management, and impacts to nearby
                    parks among other areas of the natural and built
                    environment. The City proposed in June 2016 that Pierce
                    County and the City jointly prepare a full EIS, but this
                    proposal was rejected. Given the number of unaddressed
                    concerns about the proposal and location within the City’s
                    UGA, the City therefore pursued legal challenges to the
                    County’s environmental review. After Pierce County Hearing
                    Examiner and court proceedings, in 2019 the Washington Court
                    of Appeals issued a decision upholding the City of
                    Puyallup’s right to act as the lead SEPA agency for the
                    project and to require preparation of an EIS on it. The
                    Washington Supreme Court subsequently dismissed Pierce
                    County’s petition that the Court review (and potentially
                    overturn) the Court of Appeals decision.

                    The City of Puyallup will consider all feedback from tribes,

                    will respond to timely comments in the Final EIS.

                    reasonable alternatives in the DEIS and may identify (at the

                    attain or approximate a proposal's objectives, but at a
                    lower environmental cost or decreased level of environmental
                    degradation. The City anticipates making that final

                    Pierce County has approval authority over many aspects of
                    the overall project. The City has jurisdiction over certain
                    discrete aspects of the proposal, such as specific roadway
                    mitigation requirements and some utility connections (water,
                    sewer). To ensure that significant impacts are mitigated,
                    such permitting agencies when issuing final permits, should
                    adhere to the mitigation recommendations made in the final
                    EIS.

                    The Applicant and the City of Puyallup recorded a
                    Declaration of Restrictive Covenant in August 2022 that
                    establishes a stated intent to develop the Project as an
                    “Industrial Park” consistent with the Institute for Traffic
                    Engineers (ITE) Land Use Code (LUC) 130 (ITE manual, 11th
                    edition). According to ITE LUC 130, “(a)n industrial park
                    contains several individual industrial or related
                    facilities. It is characterized by a mix of manufacturing,
                    service, and warehouse facilities with a wide variation in
                    the proportion of each type of use from one location to
                    another.” As of the preparation of this document, the
                    Applicant has yet to make a binding commitment on the final
                    end user(s) of the proposed facilities. The restrictive
                    covenant does establish that no “high cube fulfillment
                    center” uses will be occupying the structures on site.
