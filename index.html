                The NE 130th Street Infill Station for Sound Transit’s Lynnwood
                Link Extension will provide additional service to North Seattle
                residents once complete. Explore this site for information about
                the construction of station finishes, streetscape, and roadway
                improvements over the next two and a half years. Learn more about
                what to expect as we prepare for the station to be open in
                mid-2026. The Lynnwood Link Extension project, connecting to
                service from Northgate to Lynnwood City Center Station, is
                scheduled to open for service in Fall 2024.

              <p>
                In 2016 voters approved the addition of a light rail station to
                the Lynnwood Link Extension at NE 130th St by 2031. In February
                2020, the Sound Transit Board authorized staff to complete final
                design of the station, and in summer 2022 the Board approved
                additional budget and contract changes for the accelerated
                delivery of the NE 130th Street Infill Station. This decision
                advanced opening of the new station to mid-2026, revised from the
                original 2031 opening date projected in ST3.
              </p>
              <p>
                The new station will serve a growing residential neighborhood
                between the Northgate and Shoreline South/148th stations and will
                be built within the existing Lynnwood Link Extension line. Once
                complete in mid-2026 we estimate the NE 130th Street Infill
                Station will provide approximately 3,400 daily boardings with
                access to Westlake Station in 15 minutes and SeaTac/Airport
                Station in 53 minutes.

                    </a>
                    in fall 2020 to the final station design. Community members
                    were asked to share their preferences for color, seating, and
                    bollards. The blue color preferred by the community was used
                    extensively throughout the station finishes, associated
                    specifically with points of vertical circulation (stairs,
                    elevators, and escalators). The seating elements include both
                    weathered boulders that reflect the station design’s
                    recognition of nearby Thornton Creek, as well as shaped
                    concrete benches located throughout the plaza areas. The
                    bollards are a modern stainless steel type with a sloped top.

                      >Romson Bustillo</a
                    >, a Seattle-based artist, is developing designs for the
                    station artwork. Bustillo was born on the island of Mindanao
                    in the Philippines. His layered works and immersive
                    collaborations go back to his Philippine lineage, his South
                    Seattle/Pacific Northwest upbringing, and numerous research
                    travels. An artist selection panel made up of members from the
                    community and of art/design professionals were drawn to the
                    intricate detail in his prints and his inter-disciplinary
                    studio work, and chose Bustillo to create artwork for the NE
                    130th Station based on his previous work and his vision for
                    the site.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The elevated station made Bustillo think of the dwellings on
                    stilts from his birth country, and this reference is one of
                    many in his iconography of patterns that incorporate symbolic
                    elements from his culture, the cultural context of the station
                    and neighborhood, and the people who inhabit it, past and
                    present. Bustillo’s intention is to create an inviting work
                    that conveys an optimistic future, supports story-telling,
                    encourages discovery, and contributes to wayfinding.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    At the south entrance, where the majority of passengers will
                    enter the station, painted artwork will turn the guideway
                    column into a landmark that welcomes passengers as they
                    approach the station. Bustillo’s artwork will guide passengers
                    as they enter and exit the station and make their way to the
                    ticket vending machines and to the train platforms. His
                    designs will be translated into richly colored, porcelain
                    enamel panels that wrap around the entrances at both north and
                    south lobbies. The service building, in the center of the
                    station, will also be covered on its east-facing side with
                    100-foot-long mural of porcelain tiles, featuring another
                    variation of patterns and colors.

                    Romson Bustillo will be presenting to the City of Seattle’s
                    Public Art Advisory Committee on October 24 to walk through
                    some updated renderings of the artwork that will be installed
                    over the station finishes at both North and South entrances,
                    as well as the central plaza artwork. Additional updates on
                    public art at the station will be shared this fall.

                        My approach is informed by research, the location of the

                        and community workshops held. I’ve considered how the
                        monumental scale of this project allows for both intimate
                        and communal visual experiences.

                        creating and finding narratives within the artwork. Visual
                        cues will support wayfinding and draw pedestrians to the

                Construction of the NE 130th St Infill Station has occurred in
                phases as the Lynnwood Link Extension Project takes shape. Work on
                the station platform and canopy structural steel was completed,
                allowing operational testing prior to Lynnwood Link’s projected
                opening in fall 2024.

                Work is now being handed off to a different contractor that will
                complete the final package, including construction of station
                finishes, and plaza and roadway improvements. Construction and
                testing will occur between now and the opening of the station in
                mid-2026.

                </h3>
                <p>
                  Construction will ramp up at the site and you will see more
                  activity starting this fall/winter as we continue station
                  construction on the elevated track, at the ground-floor plaza
                  level, as well as the surrounding roadways. Construction will be
                  active through mid-2026, including testing the line at this
                  location, prior to opening this new station.
                </p>
                <p>
                  We strive to be a good neighbor and acknowledge that
                  construction can be disruptive. You can expect the following
                  during construction:
                </p>
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    Ongoing movement of crews and large equipment at the station
                    site and surrounding area; typical work hours are 7am-5pm,
                    Monday through Friday.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Noise, vibration, and dust associated with major construction.

                  <li>
                    Roadway closures or modifications to support construction,
                    with traffic control and detours in place, as needed. See
                    below for additional detail about long-term closures.

                  <li>
                    Early work or night work outside of typical work hours will be
                    necessary at times for utility and roadwork to minimize
                    traffic impacts or coordinate with Lynnwood Link Extension
                    testing and operations; nearby neighbors will be notified
                    directly in these situations.

                  <li>
                    There will be a long-term closure of the NE 130th St I-5
                    off-ramp (15 days) and up to ten weekend off-ramp closures to
                    prepare and reconstruct the roadway pavement. Additional
