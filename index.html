                Welcome to the City of Puyallup’s online engagement site for the
                Knutson Farms Environmental Impact Statement project. The City
                is leading the development of an Environmental Impact Statement
                (EIS) for a proposed warehousing development on the approximate
                162-acre Knutson Farm property located within unincorporated
                Pierce County. The EIS is an objective analysis of the likely
                environmental impacts of the proposal and measures to mitigate
                harmful impacts. We are committed to listening to our
                stakeholders and working with you to gather input to help inform
                the EIS. We’re glad you’re part of the conversation!

            <p>
              The DEIS contains analysis of a proposed action and two
              alternatives. Under the No Action Alternative, none of the
              proposed facilities would be constructed.

                      The proposed development includes construction of an
                      industrial park facility of up to 2.6 million square feet
                      of building area. The project would include construction
                      of seven warehouse buildings. Site work activities would
                      include grading, paving parking and truck maneuvering
                      areas, landscaping, water and sanitary sewer extensions,
                      building a storm water facility, franchise utility
                      improvements and roadway improvements.

                      Under Alternative 1, the facility constructed would be the
                      same as described for the Proposed Action; however, rail
                      lines would also be constructed to facilitate movement of
                      materials into and out of the proposed facility. The
                      proposed rail lines would be constructed to enable rail
                      access to the seven proposed warehouses from the existing
                      Meeker Southern rail line, which is located south of the
                      Project site.

                      for the Proposed Action, were adopted by the Applicant.
                      The total footprint of the Alternative 2 facilities would
                      be reduced from about 2.6 million square feet to about 1.7
                      million square feet.

                The State Environmental Policy Act (SEPA) is a state law that
                requires agencies to evaluate the likely environmental
                consequences of proposed development actions. SEPA provides
                direction for the environmental review process, including
                preparation of an environmental impact statement (EIS) for
                certain projects.

                The City of Puyallup, as lead agency, acknowledges that there is
                public interest and concern about the environmental impacts of
                implementing the proposed development plan (Proposed Action).
                Based on the level of concern and the potential for impacts that
                may occur with the implementation of the Proposed Action, the
                City has determined that a SEPA EIS will be prepared to study
                impacts regardless of whether such impacts may be significant.
                The project’s Determination of Significance can be found in the

                      An environmental impact statement (EIS) provides an
                      objective analysis of the likely environmental impacts,
                      feasible alternatives, and measures that would avoid or

                      An “impact” is a change in consequence that results from
                      an activity. Impacts can be positive, negative or both. An
                      EIS describes impacts and may identify ways to mitigate
                      them.

                    Scoping is the first step in the EIS process. During
                    scoping, we invited agencies, tribes, and the general public
                    to comment on the likely range of project alternatives and
                    areas of impact that should be evaluated. These comments
                    were used to narrow the focus of the EIS to the likely
                    significant environmental issues, eliminate insignificant
                    impacts from study, and identify alternatives for analysis
                    in the EIS.

                    The project team examined potential impacts and broke them
                    into two categories: Construction and Operations impacts.
                    Construction impacts would occur during the ongoing
                    construction of the project, while operations impacts would
                    continue throughout the lifespan and active use of the
                    project site.

                  <p>
                    DEIS definition of impact significance: SEPA requires that
                    an EIS analyze the adverse environmental impacts of a
                    proposal and identify possible mitigation measures that will
                    reduce or eliminate those impacts. For each environmental
                    resource area, the following thresholds were considered for
                    impacts:
                  </p>
                  <ul>
                    <li>
                      <b>Significant Impact:</b> the impact is irrevocable;
                      there are no regulatory requirements, design measures,
                      and/or mitigation measures that would avoid, minimize, or
                      reduce the potential impacts identified.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      <b>Mitigated Significant Impact:</b> the potential impact
                      identified is substantial and adverse; however, impacts
                      could be avoided, minimized, or reduced with
                      implementation of regulatory requirements, design
                      measures, and/or mitigation measures.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      <b>Less than Significant:</b> the potential impact is
                      neither substantial nor adverse; no mitigation is
                      required. However, Best Management Practices (BMPs) would
                      be implemented to reduce impacts as appropriate.

                    <li>
                      <b>No Impact:</b> there are no identified impacts to the

                        Analysis in the DEIS includes consideration of future
                        land use designations identified in both the Pierce
                        County Comprehensive Plan and City of Puyallup

                        below. The land use analysis evaluates the Project’s
                        potential to result in land use conflicts and/or plan
                        and policy inconsistencies that would consequently be
                        considered land use impacts.

                      <p>
                        This section describes the potential for environmental
                        impacts related to aesthetics as a result of Project
                        implementation. Aesthetic experiences can be highly
                        subjective; therefore, Project-related impacts are
                        evaluated based on the extent of the modifications to
                        existing physical conditions on the Project site as a
                        result of the Project. Given the Project’s context and
                        placement within an existing rural developed setting,
                        this analysis follows a qualitative approach to assess
                        the potential visual impacts related to the Project.
                        This analysis was performed by defining the Project
                        location and setting; identifying and characterizing the
                        existing visual resources and key viewers; and assessing
                        resource change and viewer response.
                      </p>

                      <strong>Key mitigation measures:</strong>
                      <ul>
                        <li>

                          >
                          The Applicant should use landscaping buffering to
                          promote compatibility between land uses and to reduce
                          the visual impacts of development on users of the site
                          and abutting uses, including the proposed trail. The
                          Project should comply with local building code
                          regulations, including Title 18J.10.055(6) PCC which
                          requires landscape plans that include the locations
                          and types of landscape buffers and maintenance
                          measures. The landscape buffering should also comply
                          with Title 18J.15.040 PCC, a Level 3 Landscape Buffers
                          requirement, and provide a substantial mix of
                          evergreen and other landscaping elements and walls
                          that buffer the visual impacts. Consistent with the
                          site design of the Viking Project (Phase 1 of the
                          Knutson Farms industrial warehouse complex), the site
                          plan shall be revised to include a minimum
                          15-foot-wide landscape strip to be provided along the
                          entire length of blank wall facades of buildings. A
                          mixture of medium to large evergreen conifer and
                          deciduous trees and shrubs (evergreen and/or deciduous
                          shrub mix) shall be planted for all buildings along
                          the entire length of all visible façades on buildings.
                          Pierce County policies supporting this mitigation
                          measure include LU-47.8, LU-47.9, and AM D-1. City
                          policies supporting this mitigation measure include
                          LU-22.3, CC-1.1, CC-1.2, and CC-1.3.

                    impacts. The City of Puyallup (City) has hired a team of
                    environmental consultants to conduct a rigorous and
                    independent review of the project in an environmental impact
                    statement (EIS) prepared pursuant to the State Environmental
                    Policy Act (SEPA). The City currently anticipates that
                    analysis of project impacts will continue through Spring
                    2023. Given this timeline, a Draft EIS is expected in Summer

                    The 162-acre property is located in Pierce County, just
                    outside of Puyallup’s corporate limits. However, the project

                    The original development proposal was submitted to Pierce
                    County by the landowner in 2014. The seven-building
                    warehouse project raised several questions and concerns for
                    the City of Puyallup about traffic impacts, utility needs,
                    floodplain and wetlands management, and impacts to nearby
                    parks among other areas of the natural and built
                    environment. The City proposed in June 2016 that Pierce
                    County and the City jointly prepare a full EIS, but this
                    proposal was rejected. Given the number of unaddressed
                    concerns about the proposal and location within the City’s
                    UGA, the City therefore pursued legal challenges to the
                    County’s environmental review. After Pierce County Hearing
                    Examiner and court proceedings, in 2019 the Washington Court
                    of Appeals issued a decision upholding the City of
                    Puyallup’s right to act as the lead SEPA agency for the
                    project and to require preparation of an EIS on it. The
                    Washington Supreme Court subsequently dismissed Pierce
                    County’s petition that the Court review (and potentially
                    overturn) the Court of Appeals decision.

                    The Knutson Farms EIS project is currently focused on field
                    work, impacts analysis and report writing following scoping.
                    The project applicant has clarified their proposed project,
                    and city staff is conducting environmental review. We
                    anticipate the issuance of a draft EIS in Summer 2023.

                    An EIS is prepared when the lead SEPA agency determines a
                    proposal is likely to have significant adverse environmental
                    impacts. The EIS process is a tool for identifying and
                    analyzing:

                      Scoping, the first step in developing the EIS, defines
                      which environmental factors to study and the extent of
                      analysis for each factor. As noted above, the scoping
                      public comment period helped informed which factors to
                      include in this EIS. The environmental factors for the EIS

                      (WAC 197-11-060) of a proposal. Cumulative impacts are
                      those impacts that occur when considered with the impacts
                      from other past, present, or future actions or projects.
